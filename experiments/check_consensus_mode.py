"""
Theory-experiment bridge check.

The analytic argument (Lemma: orthogonality of common signal and topology)
predicts that the correlated forecast error projects ENTIRELY onto the
consensus mode v_1 = 1/sqrt(N) -- the uniform vector. So at high rho, the
dominant SVD spatial mode u1 should be approximately UNIFORM across agents.

This script verifies that empirically. If u1 is near-uniform at high rho, the
theory's central claim is confirmed directly. If u1 has structure, the linear
argument is missing something (likely controller saturation).

Metric: coefficient of variation (CV) of |u1| across agents.
    CV -> 0   : u1 is uniform  -> consensus mode -> theory confirmed
    CV large  : u1 has structure -> not pure consensus

We compare u1 WITHOUT subtracting the mean (subtract_mean=False), because we
want to SEE the common mode, not remove it.

Run from repo root:
    python -m experiments.check_consensus_mode
